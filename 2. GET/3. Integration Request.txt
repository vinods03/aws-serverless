Why do we need the "mapping template" ?

This is basically to ensure segregation of responsibilities.
It is a good practice to ensure lambda  works with only the input it needs and doesnt have to parse the request body and extract the input it needs.
The Integration Request Mapping template does the parsing / extraction.

In the GET request, we are expecting the type of GET - single user_id or all users - in path parameters, and in the case of GET for single user_id, we are expecting the user id in query string parameters.

Integration Request Mapping Template:

{
  "type" : "$input.params("type")",
  "user_id" : "$input.params("user_id")"
}

Here:

$input -> request data (params, query strings, body etc)
$ -> request body -> but we dont need $ here
Note that both path parameters, as well as query string parameters are accessible under $input.params.


Note:

In Integration Request tab, if you enable Lambda Proxy Integration, you will not be able to modify / parse / extract input.
Also, in Integration Response, you wwill not be able to modify / parse / extract lambda output.

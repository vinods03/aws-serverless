The flow from API Gateway to Lambda is Method Request -> Integration Request
The flow from Lambda to API Gateway is Integration Response -> Method Response


For GET, we want to do both GET ALL and GET SPECIFIC
So, under the main "compare-yourself" resource, we will create a resource with name {type} -> {} indicating variable
Under this resource we will create GET method

Create a lambda function - compare-yourself-get-data
Integrate this with the above new API gateway resource / method
First, see if you are able to extract required fields and return to API gateway
Note that here, we need to extract from Path Parameters instead of Request body

Get from DynamoDB can be done later

Why do we need the "mapping template" ?

This is basically to ensure segregation of responsibilities.
It is a good practice to ensure lambda  works with only the input it needs and doesnt have to parse the request body and extract the input it needs.
The Integration Request Mapping template does the parsing / extraction.

In the DELETE request, we are expecting the user id in query string parameters.

Integration Request Mapping Template:

{
  "user_id" : "$input.params("user_id")"
}

Here:

$input -> request data (params, query strings, body etc)
$ -> request body -> but we dont need $ here


Note:

In Integration Request tab, if you enable Lambda Proxy Integration, you will not be able to modify / parse / extract input.
Also, in Integration Response, you wwill not be able to modify / parse / extract lambda output.
